The sustainable OSM maps project is divided into three parts:

* editor - a customised Potlatch 2 installation designed to make 
  it easy to add the features we're interested in

* kml_generator - a Python script that downloads interesting data
  from the OpenStreetMap eXtended API and turns it onto pretty
  KML files

* openlayers_display - some OpenLayers files to display the results
